# Dictionary
This Program takes as an input a word in the dictionary and return its definition.

This program uses a JSON file as a dictionary and prompts the user to enter a word. After the user inputs a word
the program returns one or more definitions of the word. If a word is not found, a close match to the word is outputed
to the user for them to decide if that is the correct spelling of the word they were looking for. If no close match is found
then the following is outputted to the user,"The word doesn't exist. Please double check it."
